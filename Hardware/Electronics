Things'you'll need:

Wemos D1 Mini   (I used an old V3.0)
Wemos mini OLED shield
Wemos mini battery shield
MPU6050   (I used a no-brand one) 
1s LiPo   (I used a 450mAH LiPo by EMax)
Optional: male/female connector to connect the LiPo to the battery shield in case the LiPo connector doenst fit the battery shield (as was the case for me)
1x 220uF 16V Electrolytic capacitor   (altough anything between 100 and 470 should work. Make sure it's rated for at least 6,7V )
1x Micro servo   (I used the MG90S as I like the metal gears. Make sure to order spares as about 10% are faulty from the start!
4 stackable headers

This is how you'll wire them together:

1. Solder the stackable headers on the Wemos OLED shield and the Wemos D1 microcontroller board

2. Stack them like this:
  OLED shield
  D1 mini
  Battery shield

3. Connect the servo 
  Red wire to 5V/VBus in the OLED shield
  Brown/Black to GND in the OLED shield
  Yellow/Orange to D5 in the OLED shield (GPIO 14 on the D1 mini)

4. Connect the Capacitor
  - to GND in the OLED shield
  + to 5V/Vbus in the OLED shield

5. Connect the MPU6050
  VCC to 3V3 in the OLED shield
  GND to GND in the OLED shield
  SCL to D1 in the OLED shield 
  SDA to D2 in the OLED shield
