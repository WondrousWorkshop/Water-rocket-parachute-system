  Step 2: Add the board driver URL in the Arduino IDE (Bestand > Voorkeuren) " http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json "
  Step 3: Install the board. go to Hulpmiddelen > Board > Board beheer and look for "ESP8266" 
  Step 4: Select the LOLIN(WEMOS) D1 board
  Now the board should be selectable in the dropdown menu.
