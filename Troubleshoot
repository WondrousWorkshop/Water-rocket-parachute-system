Arduino IDE does not see the Wemos D1.
  Step 1: install the driver from the official Wemos website: https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/ch340_driver.html
  Step 2: Add the board driver URL in the Arduino IDE (Bestand > Voorkeuren) " http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json "
  Step 3: Install the board. go to Hulpmiddelen > Board > Board beheer and look for "ESP8266" 
  Step 4: Select the LOLIN(WEMOS) D1 board
  Now the board should be selectable in the dropdown menu.

LiPo plug does not fit the battery shield LiPo socket
  I desolderd the standard LiPo socket and connect two wires to the + and -
  It is also possible to leave the socket on the shield and just solder two wires to the + and - on the backside of the shield.
  Then add a socket and plug to the wires. Double check the polarity. Twice.
